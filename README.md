## Coursera- Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Course Project for JHU Data Science track, class #3

This project demonstrates my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. I prepare a tidy data set to be used for later analysis.

I created an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
